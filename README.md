
## 📡 Astronomical Image Noise Reduction with Machine Learning

A Streamlit web application for reducing noise in astronomical images using a machine learning-based denoising model. Users can register/login, upload noisy images, and obtain enhanced images along with PSNR and SSIM metrics. Features include:

* 🔐 User registration and authentication
* 📤 Upload and automatic denoising of images
* 📊 Evaluation metrics (PSNR & SSIM)
* 🔍 Patch-wise comparison of noisy and denoised images
* 🧠 ML-based denoising backend (`simple_denoise`)
* 💾 SQLite database for storing user data and image records
* streamlit run app.py
